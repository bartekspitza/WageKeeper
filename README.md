WageKeeper is the first app I ever built. It is made for part-timers/freelancers. It stores all your worked shifts and calculates your next paycheck through a rich set of features.

**But how is it different from other similar apps? - Because it works even if you work at a job where:**
* You sometimes work less hours than you actually get paid for
* You NEVER have a set schedule
* You have complicated overtime benefits (i.e increased pay certain hours on certain days)
* Your salary period changes (for instance, one month you get paid for May 21 - June 22 and the next June 22 - July 17)

I built WageKeeper when I myself had a tricky job. I looked through the App Store and found nothing that satisfied me, so I decided to do it myself. It was a very rich experience and I learned a ton!
